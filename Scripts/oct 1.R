# what does one row represent? how do you know?
#a police report, i did a vibe check

# what identifies one request? how do you know?
#unqiue key, also vibe check

# take a look at our columns. what are the data types? 
#strings

# pay attention to the *_date columns. what types are those? 
#strings

# the columns are dates and times, but is that their actual data type being recognized? 

# let's see how this is a problem by dealing with a seeming easy question: 
# how long did each request take to close? 

# what if we just tried the most straightforward option: subtraction? 

# what's the problem here? 

# we can try another approach, let's use day() to pull the day out of a date. 
# bracket the first row of created_date and let's just use day() on it. 
requests$created_date[1]
day(requests$created_date[1])
month(requests$created_date[1])
year(requests$created_date[1])

# what is the value? where is that number even coming from??

# let's take a look at day day(), month(), and year() do under the hood. 
as.Date(requests$created_date[1])

# as.Date tries %Y-%m-%d so it's interpreting "02/07/2023 02:38:31 PM" as 
# July 20th, 0002 AD. 

# this is the problem even if we do it in lubridate
ymd(requests$created_date[1])

# let's figure out what's up with our representation. 
# select created_date and look at the first 10 rows. 
requests |> 
  select(created_date) |> 
  slice_head(n = 10)

# look at those 10 lines. before we can choose a parser, what do we need to know? 

# took at look at line 4 in the output. 
# 01/12/2023 08:36:16 AM

# what is the date? 
# Jan 12, 2023, 08:36:16 AM or Dec 1, 2023, 08:36:16 AM


# how could you get evidence from the data itself? imagine you're in a scenario where the
# answer isn't abundantly clear from that output. hint: regex can help with things like this. 

# what does your regex idea tell you about the data? 

# since we've done that, we can actually do our parsing now. 
# create a new column called created. keep created_date. 
# how do we do this? 
requests <- requests |> 
  mutate(created_wrong = mdy_hms(created_date))

                           tz = "America/New_York"))

# let's check out something interesting about parsing. what are the arguments 
# that are allowed in our mdy_hms() function?

# let's return to our new created column. are there any potential problems here? 
## could we have accidentally created some missing values? 
## what do you need to know to assess this? 

# are there any problems that could occur even if we didn't have any missing values at all? 
# use this as an example: 01/05/2023 01:30:00 PM
# could something be potentially risky with that? how can we check on 01:30:00 PM?
requests |> 
  count(hour = hour(created)) |> 
  print(n = 24)

# what does this tell you?

# briefly, what about chronological operations? 
requests |>

    earliest = min(created, na.rm = TRUE),

# here are a few things to do on your own: 

# first, make a plot of requests per week. however, notice there isn't a week column. 
# how should you make one? 

# second, here is a larger bit of practice. 

## your question: which city agencies close 311 requests fastest?
## you should report: 
### how many requests it received. 
### how many you were able to measure. 
### a typical time to close. 

## you should limit your results to only include agencies that had at least 500 requests.
